# tip-calculator
Tip calculator using HTML, CSS and JS.

I was able to practce writing pseudo-code alongside the actual buidling of the project.

An issue that arose that were not taken into account in my pseduo-code included not taking into account what should happen if a field is left blank upon submit.
